-On your Eclipse IDE, go into Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs > and check your installed JREs. You should have an entry with a JDK there.
 Select the Execution Env for JRE/JSE (should be jdk8 for each one). Click OK
 Then Right-Click on your Project -> Maven -> Update Project

-Setup JAVA_HOME enviroment var:
	sudo vi /etc/enviroment
	Press "i" for getting in edit mode and add these lines:
		JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
		export JAVA_HOME
	exit vim using "ESC" --> ":" --> "wq" --> "Enter"
	run this cmd: . /etc/enviroment/

-Run 'mvn test' cmd from shell to see if build & tests are going all fine. (should see "SUCCESS" near each project)
